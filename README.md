## Description
`point-and-click` is a personal project to make and to play Point and click (or Graphical Adventure or Room Escape) games without programming them. It contains a game editor and an engine for web browsers. It is make with jQuery and plain Javascript and CSS (also express is used to make it runnable from a server).
It contains an example game (Safari) made for fun and to show the potential of the engine.

## Browser Compatibility
I only tested it with Chrome but it is highly probably that also works with other browsers.

## Background
I made this project a long time ago (back in 2015) for having fun and to gift friends/family with point and click games. The tecnologies used back the where jQuery for the frontend and GAE (Google App Engine) for the backend. I changed GAE for expressJS and removed all the "personal" stuff and decided to make it public to github for the community.

## Future work
I don't have plans to mantain the project but maybe if I find some bug (or some bug is reported), I can try to fix it. Also if someone send me via PR a stage (game) I can consider it to add it to the project.

## Try it!
You can see a live example at this [Live Server](https://point-and-click.herokuapp.com/). You can tinker with the editor and with the example game, the only limitation is that doing through a Live Server you can not point to images in your computer due to security reasons. But you can use Internet images or even insert the images with a base64 string (not recommended). If you want to invest some time creating a game my recommendation is that you install the engine in your computer.
