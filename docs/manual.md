## How to Install
To install the engine in your local computer you only need to have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. Download the project in a Zip file or clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
And visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser.

From there you can go and play the example game (Safari) or edit it. For the purposes of this manual go to Edit the Safari game: `http://localhost:3000/editor/safari`
